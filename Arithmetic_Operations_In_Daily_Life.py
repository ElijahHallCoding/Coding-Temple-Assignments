# Task 1: Grocery Store Math

bread = 6.99
peanut_butter = 4.59
jelly = 5.30
total_cost = bread + peanut_butter + jelly
print(total_cost)

# Task 2: Bank Interest

# Savings account initial balance
initial_amount = 10000  # $10,000

# Yearly interest rate 
yearly_interest_rate = 7  # 7%

# Convert the percentage interest rate to a decimal
interest_rate_decimal = yearly_interest_rate / 100

# Calculate the total amount after one year
total_amount = initial_amount * (6 + interest_rate_decimal)

# Total after 1 year
print("Total amount after one year:", total_amount)
